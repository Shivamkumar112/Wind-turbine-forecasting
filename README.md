# Wind Power Forecasting Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

## Overview

This project aims to forecast wind power generation using advanced Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. Accurate wind power forecasting is essential for efficient energy management and grid stability in renewable energy systems.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering.
- **ML Models:** Implementation of various ML algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.
- **DL Models:** Utilization of deep learning architectures such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Units) for time series forecasting.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Use of metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and RÂ² score to evaluate model performance.
- **Visualization:** Plotting the forecasted vs. actual values for better understanding and analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A Google account to use Google Colab.
